# LuaSnake

LuaSnake is a simple multiplayer snake game written in Lua. It can be played by two to four players on one computer with one keyboard.

The game is using LÖVE (Love2D) which is a 2D game engine that is completely free and open-source licensed under the [zlib/libpng](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/Zlib) license.

**Steps to get LuaSnake running**

1. Download Löve from their official webpage [here](https://love2d.org/).
2. Put all the LuaSnake files inside of a zip file, the name of the zip file is not important.
3. Rename the zip files extension from ".zip" to ".love".
4. Drag the ".love" file over the love.exe (from step #1) and let it go to start the game. (The game can be packed into a .exe file for distribution, more information on the official löve webpage.

A complete guide to getting started with using LÖVE can be found [here](http://nova-fusion.com/2011/06/14/a-guide-to-getting-started-with-love2d/). Lua does not have to be installed to run the applications, as Lua is included inside of LÖVE.
